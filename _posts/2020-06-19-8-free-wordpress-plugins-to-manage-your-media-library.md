Throughout that I have been working on WordPress websites, one big part is managing the media. The capability to manage the website assets such as gallery images, music, video or downloadable attachments is a must have feature. WordPress has an easy to use core feature called [Media Library](https://en.support.wordpress.com/media/){:target="_blank"} which offers basic stuff like cropping, resizing, and rotating. Files are stored on folders based on year and month on the /wp-content/uploads directory. 

If you want more capabilities like organizing folders, renaming or compressing images, and more, you would have to install plugin(s). With that said, I have taken the initiative to compile the best Media Library management plugins for WordPress below and hope you would find it helpful.

### In this article, you will be introduced to plugins that:

1. Clean up any unused files in your Media Library
2. Replace or rename media without much hassle
3. Update thumbnail sizes after new plugin or theme activation
4. Change your server’s maximum file size upload limit
5. Easily group and search files in your Media Library
6. Compress images to optimize your website
7. Create backups of your website including Media Library


## [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/){:target="_blank"}

As the name says, this plugin allows you to regenerate all the thumbnails for one or more images in your Media Library. It also enables you to delete old sizes so you can free up some disk space.

### Common Use Cases for Regenerate Thumbnails
- You changed to a WordPress theme that uses different size for Featured Image
- A new thumbnail size has been added (maybe from a plugin) and you want to update past uploads to have that size
- You changed the dimensions of existing thumbnail via Settings → Media

## [Enable Media Replace](https://wordpress.org/plugins/enable-media-replace/){:target="_blank"}

As straightforward as its name, this plugin allows you to replace any files in your Media Library by uploading a new file in its place without the need to delete, rename and re-upload the file.

This is useful for situations such as when you want to:

- replace a file but keep its filename
- replace a file and update its filename as well as all links pointing to the current file.

## [Media File Renamer Auto](https://wordpress.org/plugins/media-file-renamer/){:target="_blank"}

There are times when renaming a file then re-uploading it and deleting the old one in the Media Library is quite tedious. This plugin enable you to rename a file by its title. Just make sure the Sync Slug option is enabled in the plugin Settings if you want to change the Permalink as well upon updating the file name.


The PRO version will give you additional features like renaming by Post title where the file is attached and updating all links referencing to it.

## [Upload Max File Size](https://wordpress.org/plugins/upload-max-file-size/){:target="_blank"}

You may encounter a situation where you can’t upload more than 5MB per file in your Media Library. This is not a WordPress error but actually your web hosting server configuration set for security purposes. You can bypass this by installing and activating the above plugin which enables you to set your own max file upload limit. 

Note that this plugin only accepts values in byte so if you want 25MB then you need to set the result of 25 x 1024000 as the new value.

## [Media Cleaner](https://wordpress.org/plugins/media-cleaner/){:target="_blank"}

It is easy for your WordPress Media Library to become cluttered and full of unused images. If left unattended, this can slow down the speed of your website since low disk space decreases functionality and performance. 

Media Cleaner can scan your entire Media Library to see which files are unused. Its PRO version will also scan the ‘uploads’ folder therefore it can detect images uploaded via FTP or images not referenced in Media Library. 

## [Enhanced Media Library](https://wordpress.org/plugins/enhanced-media-library/){:target="_blank"}

Do you have a lot of media to manage ? If so, then this plugin is for you. It has the ability to group your media into categories and tags so you can save hours searching through your files.

### Plugin primary features:
- Group and filter files into categories or tags for easy search
- Enable and disable upload of certain file type or extension
- Enhance WordPress core features such as image gallery, audio & music playlist to display your media by categories
- Create backups and Import/Export Media Library settings
	
## [WP Smush Image Compression and Optimization](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/){:target="_blank"}

As the number of visitors on your website grow, it is important to serve the pages as quick as possible. If you have a lot of images to display, the page load may slow down which can drive your visitors away. With WP Smush plugin, you can compress the size of your images so that your website will load faster. A 3 MB image can be reduced to as low as 100 KB.

The plugin also offers paid extensions to let you choose where you want to store your backups ([Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/){:target="_blank"}, [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/){:target="_blank"}, [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/){:target="_blank"}, etc).
